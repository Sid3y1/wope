## Requirements ##

Wope uses PHP5 and mySQL 5.
Here is a list of all the required PHP modules :
	* GD 
	* XML


## Installation process ##

Download the archive, and uncompress it where you want to install the site.
Fire up your favorite web browser and go on this URL : http://your_domain_name.com/wope/installer
Follow the instructions of the installer and if nothing goes wrong you should 
have a working copy of Wope installed.

If the installation process fails, you can bypass the installer and edit the 
configuration file yourself.
In your Wope directory, go in the include directory and edit the config_secure.inc file.
Read the comments on the file, to understand what you have to fill in.
After that, you will have to run the SQL dump file named wope-dump.sql, located in your wope directory.
You can't run the dump with phpMyadmin because phpMyadmin does not understand dumps
with delimiter changes. The only solution you have is to run the dump with mysqldump 
commande. On a Linux server :
mysqldump -u your_user -pyour_password your_database_name < dump-wope.sql
